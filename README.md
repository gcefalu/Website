To run the site you can either use nitr from RStudido of you can downloadd the files to your directory, and using RStudio and run the command rmarkdown::render_site() within the website directory command line inRStudio. I have included the geojsn becuase I could not find a url of the file.  You can download the file to your website directory to run the site.
